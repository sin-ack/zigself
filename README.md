An implementation of the Self programming language.

## What is Self?

[Self](https://selflanguage.org/) is a programming language designed in 1986 at
Xerox PARC. It is an object-oriented programming language which uses
_prototype-based inheritance_ as its basis and message-passing as its execution
method. It is dynamically (but strongly) typed.

Self uses an image-based approach for runtime. All the objects in the system
are stored in a _Self world_ and turned into a _snapshot_ for saving. At
runtime, objects can be interacted with, created and destroyed without losing
state on other objects.

## Build-time requirements

You need the Zig compiler, preferably one built with the known-good version
commit. You can find the source code, instructions for building, and more on the
[Zig repository](https://github.com/ziglang/zig).

Latest Zig commit known to work is [`cffbb32d3`](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/commit/cffbb32d3).
Earlier and later versions may work but there are no guarantees.

## Building zigSelf

1. Clone the repository with submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sin-ack/zigself`
2. Run the code: `zig build run -- examples/fibonacci.self`

That's it! If you want to build a release version, you can build one with
`zig build -Drelease-fast=true` and the binary will be in `zig-out/bin/`.

There is an (experimental) REPL that you can run with `zig build run -- repl.self`.
